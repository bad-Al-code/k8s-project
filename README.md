# K8s

This project implements a robust, scalable and Kubernetes-native observability stack designed to Monitor and log multiple microservices. As a full-stack engineer, the goal is to eliminate the pain point of troubleshooting performance issues and errors in a microservice architecture by providing comprehensive visibility.

The solution uses **Prometheus** for metrics, **Loki** for log aggregation, and **Grafana** for powerful visualization and dashboards.
